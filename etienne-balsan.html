		<h2>Etienne Balsan: Gabrielle's first lover</h2>
		<p>At the cabaret, Gabrielle meets the young French ex-cavalry officer and wealthy textile heir Etienne Balsan. At the age twenty-three, she became his mistress. For the next three years, she lived with him in his chateau near Compiègne, an area known for its wooded equestrian paths and the hunting life. It was a life style of self-indulgence, Balsan's wealth and leisure allowing the cultivation of a social set who reveled in partying. He lavished Chanel with the beauties of &quot;the rich life&quot;—diamonds, dresses, and pearls.Chanel began designing hats while living with Balsan because she started to get bored of her life and he could afford her the materials she needed.</p>

		<p>In 1909, when Chanel settled in Paris, he lent her his bachelor flat on the ground floor, 160 Boulevard Malesherbes, and helped her to open a boutique in Deauville. Balsan introduced her to Paris society, including Englishman Arthur Boy Capel who later became Chanel&rsquo;s lover, and who helped Chanel to finance her early fashion business.</p>
		<p>They remained friends throughout their lives.</p>
